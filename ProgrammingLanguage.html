      <h1>OOP in JAVA </h1>
      <h3>On the Basis of Tribhuvan University BCA 3rd Semester Syllabus</h3>
      <hr>
      <h2>Unit-1 Introduction to JAVA</h2>
      <div class="Definition">
        <h3>1) Definition:</h3>
          <ul type="circle">
            <li>
              Java is a simple, object oriented, distributed, compiled/interpreted, robust, secure, architecutre neutral, portable, high perfomance, multithreaded and dynamic language. 
            </li>
            <li>It is designed in 1995 by Sun MicroSystem, created by James Gosling and team.</li>
            <li>It is platform independent, which means that we only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms.</li>
            <li>It is used to develop apps for Google's Android OS, Various Desktop Applications, such as multimedia players, antivirus programs, web applications, banking software and many more.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3 class="features">Features of JAVA</h3>
          <h4>1. Simple</h4>
            <p>Java is very easy to learn and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun, Java languate is simple programming language because</p>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>Java syntax is based on C++.</li>
                <li>Java has removed many complicated and rarely used features, for eg: explicit pointers, operator overloading etc.</li>
                <li>There is no need to remove unrefrence objects because there is and Automatic Garbage Collection in Java</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
          <h4>2. Object-oriented Programming</h4>
            <p>Java is an oop language. Everything in java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>3. Platform Independent</h4>
            <p>Java code can be run on multiple platforms. For example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaries, Maclos etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into byte conde. This byte code is platform independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms i.e. Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).</p>
            <br>
          <h4>4. Secured</h4>
            <p> Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus free systems. Java is secured because</p>
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>No explicite pointer</li>
              <li>Java programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox</li>
              <li>Class loader: <p>Class loader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment(JRE). Which is used to load classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically.</p></li>
              <li>It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources.</li>
              <li>Bytecode Verifider:<p>It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access right to objects.</p></li>
              <li>Security Manager:<p>It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.</p></li>
            </ul>
          <h4>5. Architecture-neutral</h4>
            <p>Java is architecture-neutral because there are no implementation dependent features. For example, the size of primitive data types is fixed. <br> <br>
            In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architecture in Java.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>6. Robust</h4>
            <p>Robust simply means strong. Java is robust because</p>
            <ul type="circle">
              <li>It  uses strong memory management.</li>
              <li>There is automatic garbage collection in Java. Which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by Java application anymore.</li>
              <li>There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java. All these point makes Java Robust.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <h4>7. Portable</h4>
            <p>Java is portable because it facilities us to carry the Java byte code to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>8. High Performance</h4>
            <p>Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming language because java byte code is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages (c, C++).</p>
            <br>
          <h4>9. Distributed</h4>
            <p>Java is distributed because it facilites users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI (Remote Method INvocation) and EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) are used for creating distributed applications. This features of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>10. Multi-threaded</h4>
            <p>A threade is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java program's that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi threading is that it doesnot occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, web applications etc.</p>
            <br>
          <h4>11. Dynamic</h4>
            <p>Java is dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages. i.e. C, C++.<br>Java supports dynamic collection and automatic memory management(Garbage Collection).</p>

        <h3>2) History of Java</h3>
          <p>Java was orginally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at that time.</p>
